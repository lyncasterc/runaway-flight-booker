# Runaway

Runaway is a very simple  one-way flight booker toy app.

This project was completed as part of The Odin Project's Ruby on Rails cirriculum. 
The assignment can be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/building-advanced-forms)

The goal of this project is to get comfortable with building more complex forms and using nested forms.
